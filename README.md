JavaScript Palindrome Checker is a repository that provides a simple and customizable tool for checking whether a given string is a palindrome or not, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

The repository includes a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide the foundation for the palindrome checker tool. The HTML files include the basic structure for the tool and user interface, while the CSS files provide the styling and layout of the tool buttons and display. The JavaScript files contain the logic and algorithms for checking whether a given string is a palindrome or not, as well as updating the tool display.

Users can customize the palindrome checker tool by modifying the JavaScript code or adding new features. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.
